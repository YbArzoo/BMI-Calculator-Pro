# BMI-Calculator-Pro
Python BMI calculator Pro
Its  a BMI calculator. It obviously calculates your BMI (Body Mass index) 
I used Python to create this project.
I named it BMI Calculator Pro because it can calculate your BMI by taking inputs just the way you want. If you know your weight in kg and know your height in metres it can calculate your BMI. Even if you know your height in Feets and inches it can calculate your height.
